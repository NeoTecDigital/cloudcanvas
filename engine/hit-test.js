 * Hit-testing the Pin tree: "which Pin is under this point".
 *
 * The engine resolves a Pin from a DOM node in exactly one way -
 * `.cloudcanvas-pin[data-pin-id]`, the same hook the pointer router
 * (`pinForEvent`) and the Sandbox's placement-time container drop
 * (`containerAt`) already read. This is that resolution promoted to a core query
 * so a dragged Pin can find what it was released over, and so any caller that
 * needs the pin tree hit-tested (a drop, a z-order pick) asks it here rather
 * than re-deriving the class-and-id walk.
 *
 * Deepest-first is the whole contract: a nested Pin's element sits *inside* its
 * parent's scope well, so the innermost Pin at a point is the topmost element in
 * the paint stack there. `document.elementsFromPoint` returns that stack in that
 * order, so the first resolvable Pin in it is the deepest one under the point -
 * the correct drop target. An environment with no layout (happy-dom, under the
 * unit suite) has no such stack; there the event's own `target` is the single
 * honest answer, and a caller expresses "released over X" through that target.
 *
 * `ignore` skips a Pin and its whole subtree: a Pin being dragged is the topmost
 * element under its own release point, and a Pin can never be dropped into
 * itself or into one of its own descendants.

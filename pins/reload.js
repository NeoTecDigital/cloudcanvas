 * Nothing here touches the DOM or a Pin's state. `Pin` applies these decisions

 *  - `persistent` : stays mounted, hidden via `.is-dormant`, out of the render
 *                   loop (no ticks, no content work, no measurement).
 *  - `lazy`       : absent until first required; children are provisioned by the
 *                   `loadChildren` provider at that point. Once provisioned it
 *                   behaves like `persistent` until `unload()` resets it.

 * Reparenting: moving a live Pin from wherever it is nested into a new parent,
 * or back out to the canvas root, without ever destroying it.
 *
 * A free function taking the Pin first, beside `resizePin` and `rotatePin`: one
 * primitive, two directions, and the two are the *same* operation with the
 * source and target roles reversed - never a rebuild. The Pin instance survives
 * untouched: its `traits` Map, its particle, its selection and drag state, its
 * element and every listener on it. Only two things change - which scope holds
 * it, and where inside that scope it sits.
 *
 * The membership half is already solved and is reused, not reimplemented:
 * `addChild` / `removeChild` (`./pin-scope.js`) relink the graph, move the
 * element between scope wells, re-attach the renderer, and wake the subtree -
 * and `addChild` already detaches the Pin from its current parent first. What
 * they do *not* do is convert coordinates: a Pin dropped at a canvas point has
 * to land at that same visible place in its new parent's local space. That
 * conversion is the whole of what this module adds, through `scopeOriginOf`
 * (`./pin-element.js`) - the inverse of the sum `getGlobalBounds` walks.

/**
 * Move `pin` under `newParent`, or - with `newParent === null` - out to the

 *
 * The point is the top-left corner the Pin should come to rest at, in canvas
 * space. It is optional: with none, the Pin's current global corner is used, so
 * a reparent with no position keeps it exactly where it already is (which is
 * what a drop wants - the drag has already moved it to the release point).
 *
 * @param {Pin} pin the Pin to move
 * @param {Pin|null} newParent the Pin to nest under, or null to promote to root
 * @param {{x?: number, y?: number}} [position] canvas-space top-left to land at

/**
 * Bring `newParent`'s scope well to its settled, populated geometry *now* - the
 * one deliberate crossing of the renderer's "structure changes settle next frame"
 * contract, scoped to this call alone.
 *
 * Ordinarily `addChild` only enqueues a structure invalidation: with a renderer
 * attached the moved element, the well's `cc-populated` box, and the re-measured
 * `_scopeOffset` all settle over the *following* frame(s). That deferral is
 * correct for dirty-marking, which is free to be a frame late - but `reparentPin`
 * needs the *current* frame's correct scope origin to convert the drop point, and
 * the error is not self-correcting: once the Pin's local position is computed
 * against a stale, empty-well offset (an empty well is `display: none`, so its
 * measured offset is zero), no later frame ever re-derives it, and the Pin lands
 * permanently off by that offset - the ~66px drop the empty-well case exhibits,
 * exactly the populated well's own `margin-top` + content height.
 *
 * So we do here, synchronously, precisely what the structure flush and the
 * scope-well pass would have done, in the same order: move the element into the
 * well, grant the well its `cc-populated` box (which is what lifts its layout
 * offset off zero, `display: none` -> `display: block`), and read that offset
 * back. The `offsetTop`/`offsetLeft` read in `captureScopeOffset` forces the one
 * layout the conversion depends on.
 *
 * Idempotent when the well was already populated (a container that already held a
 * child): the element append is a no-op if it is already there, `cc-populated` is
 * unchanged, and the offset re-reads to the same value - so the already-correct
 * populated-container case is never double-counted or regressed. The renderer's
 * own next flush repeats all three harmlessly.

/* ------------------ IN-PLACE REORDER (Sprint 8.2) ------------------ */

/**
 * Reorder `pin` within its flow container, moving it to sit immediately before
 * `beforeSibling` - or to the end when that is null - in both the DOM and the
 * `Pin.children` iteration order.
 *
 * A reorder is not a reparent, and deliberately does *not* go through
 * `removeChild`/`addChild`: `pin` is already a child of `container`, so there is
 * no relinking, no renderer re-attach, no coordinate conversion, and no well to
 * settle - only order changes. The two orders it changes have to move together
 * because two different layers read them: the browser paints the DOM, and the
 * serializer walks `children`. `Pin.children` is a `Set`, whose iteration order
 * is insertion order, and a `Set` has no insert-at-index - so the order is
 * rebuilt by clearing and re-adding in sequence, which is sufficient precisely
 * because insertion order is the whole contract. The element moves with a single
 * native `insertBefore`, which relocates it rather than cloning.
 *
 * @param {Pin} container the flow parent both siblings belong to
 * @param {Pin} pin the child being moved

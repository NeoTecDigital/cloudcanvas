 *
 * Focus & render-root navigation.
 *
 * The session owns the state (`focusedPin`, `focusStack`, `_forwardStack`, the
 * renderer); this module owns the transitions between states. Every entry
 * pushed onto either stack carries three things - the focused Pin, the camera,
 * and the *render root* - so traversing restores all three through one path.
 *
 * **Zooming into a Pin promotes it.** `focus()` makes the targeted Pin the new
 * render root: its subtree stays mounted, its full ancestor chain stays mounted
 * with it - that chain is the breadcrumb, and it is what keeps the scope above
 * navigable - and everything else demotes. That is what "zoom in" has always
 * meant on this canvas, and since 0.4.0 it is what the default does. `focus(pin, {promote: false})` is the
 * camera-only look, kept for chrome that wants to point the camera at something
 * without restructuring the canvas underneath it.
 *
 * **Back and forward are browser-shaped.** `popFocus()` pops the focus stack and
 * pushes what it left onto the forward stack; `goForward()` is its exact mirror.
 * Any *new* navigation invalidates the forward stack, which is the one rule that
 * keeps a history linear - and it is enforced in a single place, `focusPin`,
 * which every new navigation runs through and neither traversal does.

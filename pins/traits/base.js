 * Pin lifecycle signals: the one mechanism by which state changes *inside* a Pin
 * reach a session-level observer.
 *
 * A Pin is an EventTarget, but its events never cross into another Pin, so the
 * PinManager - the only component that knows every Pin - subscribes to these
 * types on registration and re-broadcasts them (`PinManager.onSignal`). The
 * session is the single consumer: it is what turns `activate` and `select` into
 * cursor targets, and `deactivate` and `destroy` into their release. Nothing
 * else listens, and nothing polls.
 *
 * `activate` / `deactivate` are a pair, and both are announced exactly once per
 * real transition: an activation cursor is claimed by the first and released by
 * the second, because a Pin that went back to sleep has genuinely stopped being
 * the most recently activated one.
 *
 * `drag:start` / `drag:end` are the same shape for movement, emitted by
 * `DraggableTrait` at the drag *threshold* rather than at the press - a click
 * that never crossed it emits neither, so a listener that persists positions is
 * never woken by a click. `drag:end` carries the final canvas position and a
 * `cancelled` flag (the drag the platform took away, see `cancelDrag`).
 *
 * `resize:start` / `resize:end` are the same pair for the Pin's *box*, emitted
 * by `ResizableTrait` (`./resizable.js`) at the same threshold and with the same
 * `cancelled` convention. `resize:start` carries `{width, height, direction}`,
 * the box the gesture is leaving from; `resize:end` carries the final box.
 *
 * `edit` is the edit lock's transition, payload `true` on entry and `false` on
 * exit; the session announces both (`../../engine/announcer.js`).

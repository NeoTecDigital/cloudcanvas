 * PinSignalBus: the one route by which state changes inside a Pin reach an
 * observer outside it.
 *
 * A Pin is an EventTarget, but its events never cross into another Pin, so a
 * listener would otherwise have to be attached Pin by Pin by every interested
 * party. Instead the PinManager - the only component that knows every Pin -
 * attaches one listener per Pin per signal type, and re-broadcasts to whoever
 * subscribed here. Today that is the session, turning `activate` / `select` into
 * cursor targets and `destroy` into their release.
 *
 * The bus carries the native `PinEvent` untouched: `event.type` is the signal,
 * `event.detail.source` is the Pin, `event.payload` is the new state.

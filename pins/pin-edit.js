 *
 * The edit lock: while a Pin is being edited, nothing renders into it.
 *
 * A display trait owns the inside of the content node and rewrites it from
 * `pin.contents`. An editor - a `contenteditable` node, an `<input>`, an IME
 * composition in flight - lives inside that same node, and a render during the
 * edit destroys it: the node identity, the caret, the selection, and the
 * half-typed word all go with it. No amount of care inside a trait can prevent
 * that, because the trait is not the one deciding when to run.
 *
 * So the lock is a *deferral*, never a drop:
 *
 *   - `beginEdit()` closes the content funnel and announces `'edit'` (true),
 *   - every render request made while it is closed sets `_editDirty` and returns
 *     without touching the DOM,
 *   - `endEdit()` opens it again, replays exactly one content invalidation - so
 *     the Pin lands on whatever its contents finished as, not on a stale queue
 *     of intermediate states - and announces `'edit'` (false).
 *
 * One gate, at the top of `renderContent` (`./pin-render.js`), covers both
 * callers by construction: the renderer's batched content pass and the
 * synchronous fallback path both funnel through it.
 *
 * Every function takes the Pin as its first argument.

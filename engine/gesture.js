 * Gesture state: the pointer stream's ownership, the pinch, and the end of a
 * drag.
 *
 * `./pointer.js` is the DOM's door - it decides *what* an event is (a Pin
 * gesture, a camera gesture, a wheel) and routes it. This module is the state
 * machine underneath that decision: who holds the pointer stream, what the two
 * live contacts of a pinch were last measured as, and how a gesture ends when
 * nothing ends it. The split is the same one `./frame.js` draws against the
 * session - the door stays readable, the machinery stays testable.
 *
 * The session owns the *fields* (`activeDragPin`, `isPanning`, `lastPointer`,
 * `activePointers`, `pinch`, `_pendingCapture`); every function here takes the
 * session as its first argument and moves them.

 * only buys the stream back from an iframe or a cross-window drag, and that
 * only matters once the gesture is a real drag.
 *
 * `declined` is decided here and never revisited: a gesture that started on a
 * control or in selectable text must keep its native stream for the whole of
 * its life (the browser drives a text selection from the moves it delivers to
 * the text, and a retargeted `mouseup` is a button that cannot be pressed).

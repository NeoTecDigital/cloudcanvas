 * Pin element: everything a Pin does to its backing DOM node.
 *
 * Three concerns, all of them mechanical, all of them guarded for headless use
 * (no `document`, or a Pin deliberately built without an element):
 *
 *   - structure  : the fixed `.cloudcanvas-pin > content + scope` two-child shape,
 *   - membership : mount / unmount, and the reload strategy's resting DOM state,
 *   - measurement: layout-space reads and the cached scope offset they feed.
 *
 * Every function takes the Pin as its first argument. `Pin` keeps thin methods
 * that forward here, so the class stays the model and this stays the mechanics.
 * Nothing here decides *whether* a Pin should be mounted - that is reload policy
 * (`./reload.js`) - and nothing here runs a trait hook.

 * real position within the parent's scope is its own `offsetLeft/offsetTop`, read
 * here - in the renderer's batched read phase (`measureLayout`'s only caller under
 * a renderer) - so no consumer ever reads live layout on demand. That is what
 * keeps the fix inside Phase 8's read/write split: the live geometry a flow child
 * needs is captured once per frame with every other measurement, never mid-write
 * (`../engine/renderer.js`).
 *
 * The scope container is `position: relative`, so it is a flow child's
 * `offsetParent`, and it carries no border or padding (an outline stands in for
 * the border, and there is no padding) - so `offsetLeft/offsetTop` are measured
 * from the same scope-content origin a free child's particle x/y uses. That shared
 * origin is precisely what lets `globalBoundsOf` swap one for the other.
 *
 * A transform-placed Pin (every free child, every root) clears the cache back to
 * null, so `globalBoundsOf` reads its particle.

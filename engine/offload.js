 *
 * Lazy offload: the viewport-driven counterpart to `reload: 'lazy'`.
 *
 * `reload: 'lazy'` lazily *creates* a scope's children once, on first visit. This
 * pass is the opposite direction on a different axis: a Pin flagged `offload`
 * whose global box has left the visible canvas (past a configurable margin) has
 * its element detached from the document - model, particle, traits and contents
 * all retained - and reattached the moment the camera pans or zooms it back into
 * range. It is DOM virtualization, not destruction: nothing is torn down and no
 * lazy provider is re-armed (that is `unload()`, a heavier and separate thing).
 *
 * The mechanism is deliberately *not* new: setting `pin._offloadDormant` makes
 * `resolveRenderMode` (`../pins/reload.js`) resolve the Pin to `unmounted`, so the
 * detach/reattach travels the exact same, already-proven structure-flush path the
 * `active` reload strategy uses when a scope sleeps. This pass only decides *when*
 * to raise and lower that one flag; `ConjugateRenderer` does the rest in the same
 * frame it does every other membership change.
 *
 * Two invariants shape the design:
 *
 *   - **Root-only evaluation.** Only root Pins are tested, against their correct
 *     `getGlobalBounds()`. Detaching a root's element takes its whole subtree out
 *     of the document with it, so nested Pins ride their root rather than being
 *     tested one by one. (This also sidesteps `ParticleEngine.queryBox`, whose
 *     intersection test compares a nested Pin's *local* bounds against a global
 *     rectangle - correct for roots, wrong for anything nested.)
 *   - **Camera-gated.** The sweep runs only when the viewport version moved (or a
 *     new offload Pin was just adopted), never on an idle frame, so the engine's
 *     idle-canvas-zero-writes invariant is preserved: a still camera does no
 *     offload work at all.

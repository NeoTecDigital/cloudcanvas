 *
 * The scope-well pass: giving a Pin's child container a size.
 *
 * A scope well is `position: relative` around absolutely positioned children, so
 * it has no intrinsic height at all. Without a written `min-height` it collapses
 * and its children spill over whatever is below them; with one, it is a frame
 * that clips. This is where that height comes from.
 *
 * Two answers per parent, both derived from the Pin graph and never from layout:
 *
 *   - *extent*    - the furthest bottom edge across the parent's **live**
 *                   children. A dormant or unmounted child occupies nothing,
 *                   which is the whole point of it being asleep.
 *   - *populated* - the same question asked as a boolean, and the only thing
 *                   that grants the well its box, border, gap and clipping
 *                   (`cc-populated` in `CANVAS_DEFAULT_CSS`).
 *
 * One parent is exempt from the first answer and not the second: a *flow*
 * container (`pin.layout` is 'row', 'column' or 'grid'). Its children are placed
 * by flex or grid and their particle x/y describe nothing, so an extent measured
 * from them is measured from where they used to be; such a well is left to size
 * itself from its own content and only `populated` is written.
 *
 * Writing a min-height changes the parent's own box, so the caller re-measures
 * the parent afterwards. That is a one-level-per-frame convergence, not a loop:
 * the parent's new size feeds *its* parent's extent next frame, each level
 * settles once, and the whole-pixel change gate below stops the cascade the
 * moment a value repeats.

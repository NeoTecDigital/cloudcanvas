 * The session's side of the cursor system.
 *
 * `src/pins/cursor.js` owns what a cursor *is* - the utility Pin, the traits,
 * the overlay drawing. This module owns when the session builds it, how Pin
 * signals become cursor targets, and where the redraw sits in the frame. The
 * session keeps thin forwarding methods, exactly as it does for navigation.
 *
 * Cursor state has a single writer. Focus is written by `./navigation.js`,
 * because focus is already session state; selection and activation arrive as Pin
 * signals (`../pins/traits/base.js`) that the manager re-broadcasts, and
 * `handlePinSignal` below is the one place they are turned into targets. There
 * is no polling and no second route.

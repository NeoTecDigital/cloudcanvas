 * The compositor hint, and why it is not a stylesheet rule.
 *
 * `will-change: transform` is a promise to keep a GPU layer alive. Declared on
 * `.cloudcanvas-pin` it is a promise made about *every* Pin on the canvas,
 * forever - a thousand stationary cards, a thousand promoted layers, and a
 * memory profile that has nothing to do with what is moving. Declared on a class
 * the renderer grants and withdraws, it costs exactly what is in motion.
 *
 * Withdrawal is delayed rather than immediate: a Pin between two drag steps, or
 * on the flat part of an eased camera move, is still-but-not-finished, and
 * dropping the layer there is the jank the hint exists to prevent.

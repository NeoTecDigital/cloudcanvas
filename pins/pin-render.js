 *   - the content class: re-asserted below, because losing it is silent.
 *
 * The trait contract, in one sentence: a trait owns what is *inside* the content
 * node, and touches its class list with `classList.add/remove/toggle` - never
 * `element.className = '...'`, which erases the structural class the pointer
 * router, the text-selection predicate, and the stylesheet all key on. The
 * funnel repairs that class, but nothing can repair the trait's own classes it
 * takes down with it.

 * The Pin's root element and its scope container are never handed to a trait,
